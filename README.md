## Hello! 👋 I'm Tamires Nunes!


I'm a software developer with a passion for system architecture and design. I love unraveling the mysteries behind robust and elegant systems. Recently, I had the opportunity to dive into a proprietary language, which provided a great learning experience and showed me that challenges fuel growth! 🚀

And speaking of cool projects, I had the joy of working on something that combined technology and entertainment, providing some leisure time for users. After all, code can bring joy too, right? 😉

In my tech world...
Main Focus: System Architecture and Design
Mindset: I love agile cultures! I believe that collaboration and adaptability are key to the success of any project and to the development of each team member. 🌱
Experience: I've navigated through seas of code in various technologies, including a proprietary language that challenged me quite a bit (and made me learn a lot!).
My journey with the community... ❤️
I'm super engaged with tech communities! Pyladies, Minas da TI, and AfroPython have been (and continue to be!) incredible sources of inspiration and support on my journey.

Currently, I have the honor of being a co-organizer of Minas da TI, a welcoming and active community whose main goal is to help more women enter and thrive in the tech field. Seeing this community grow and impact lives is something that fills me with pride! ✨

## Hi there, I'm Tamires Nunes ðŸ‘‹


I am a software developer with a focus on system architecture and design. Currently, I work with a proprietary language, which has been a challenging yet enriching opportunity for self-development. Additionally, I am involved in a project that offers users moments of leisure, combining technology and entertainment. I value teams that adopt agile cultures, as I believe they promote growth for both the team and individuals. My career is marked by strong engagement with tech communities such as Pyladies, Minas da TI, and AfroPython, which have inspired and supported me. Currently, I am a co-organizer of Minas da TI, a safe and active community that helps women enter the technology field.
